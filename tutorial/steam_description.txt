[h1]“Herzland” 1.7.3: The Republican Dream[/h1]

It was twenty-nine years ago when the might of the Griffonian Empire was broken. Not by an outside force, but by the popular will. The griffons demanded freedom, justice and prosperity. The emperor was forced to flee the capital and the tricolour, the symbol of freedom, waved from every tower. The griffons were free and for a brief beautiful moment, the future seemed an endless opportunity.

Twenty-eight years ago, that dream shattered. Counterrevolutionary forces destroyed most of the armies loyal to the Republic, and those who could escape marched north to the duchy of Cloudbury, where they fought a brutal war against the local nobility. Under the leadership of President-Marshal Alexander Kemerskai, the republicans succeeded in overthrowing the Cloudburian government, establishing the Griffonian Republic. 

That Republic, today, is merely a shadow of the dream for which so many bled. Warlords and bandits rule in the countryside. The National Republican Party has split into factionalism and the people grow hungry and tired. But those who were there, those fateful moments twenty-nine years ago, still tell stories of the time when all griffons lived in freedom. A dream worth fighting for. 

It takes a single flame to bring light to darkness.
A single dream to bring a better future.
