The ‘Trotists’ envisioned them as the final word against frontier predators and localized threats, able to defend a village from elder dragons or work closely with infantry to clear out a rogue Changeling hive.

It was effective as an improved breakthrough tank, but the mechanical issues were not entirely solved and it remained quite slow."

 BAL_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As tanks developed, two different schools of thought arose on their use in the Equestrian military. The ‘Gallopists’ foresaw the need for a new, rapid response capability to counter the recent rise in surprise Changeling incursions and infiltrations, and other, previously unanticipated, threats. Their initial light tank design, the Breezie, was very fast, but poorly armed and armoured. Never intended for a full scale war, delays in its replacement and increasing border incursions led to it being refined and produced in larger than planned numbers."

The final result, once efforts to make room for wings of pegasi crew members were abandoned, was as idiosyncratic as its development, and little resembled other Equestrian designs. The Muletilda was lightly armoured, had limited firepower, but was fast, reliable, and a massive improvement over the Breezie."

Ambition met reality, and the magitek elements were abandoned due to a lack of required specialist unicorn mechanics. When the Twilight finally began production, Equestria was a new, reformed military machine, and it symbolised the awakening of Equestrian military power."

 SIC_knights:0 "Редиарио"
 SIC_knights_desc:0 "Начиная с эпохи древней Карфинской Империи, грифоны Сикамеона предпочитали ретиариев - быстрых и ловких бойцов, которые окружают своих противников, использующих мечи и щиты, с помощью сети и трезубца, символам феодализма, которыми и является рыцари. Называемые редиарио в наше время, они сменили трезубцы и сети на винтовки, лопаты и маскировочной сетки, и готовы противостоять врагу и упорно удерживать линию, по-прежнему загоняя их в ловушки и используя различные хитрости для уничтожения своих соперников."
 SIC_tech_knights:0 "Дивизия ретиариев I"
 SIC_tech_knights_desc:0 "Возможно, они неизвестны всему миру, но их рыцари имперской Грифонии опасаются их скорости и хитрости. Традиции ретиариев, возможно, даже старше самих рыцарей и восходят к древним и скромным рыбакам, вынужденного сражаться. Не обладая физической стойкостью рыцарей, ретиарии могут похвастаться огромной скоростью на марше и могут упрямо окапываться, чтобы отбить штурм войск, по уши закованных в броню."
 SIC_tech_knights2:0 "Дивизия ретиариев II"

 SIC_tech_knights_magical:0 "Ретиарии-профессионалы"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical_desc:0 "Традиционно ретиарии были нерегулярной силой, приобретая свои навыки через призму собственного опыта, а старшие бойцы передавали свою мудрость новобранцам. Превращение этих отрядов ополчения в подразделения спецназа — это естественная эволюция. Меньшее бойцов количество также означает, что мы можем предоставить им больше особого и экспериментального оружия и снаряжения."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2:0 "Грифоны из морских мифов"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2_desc:0 "Никто, кроме самой лучшей элиты как в умственном, так и в физическом мастерстве, не будет допущен к обучению и получению почетного титула редиарио, и, благодаря этому, эти отряды будут считаться героями из легенд, происходящими из мира морских монстров и самой Сикейции."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular:0 "Поддерживать эгалитарные стандарты"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular_desc:0 "Ретиарии всегда были символом равенства и того, что любой простой грифон может взять имеющееся у него оружие и противостоять угнетателям. Расслоение наших войск путём введения более строгих стандартов было бы богохульством по отношению к нашим традициям и принципам."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2:0 "Легионы моря"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2_desc:0 "Любой грифон может получить легендарный титул Редиарио, если будет достаточно усердно тренироваться и проявит себя в бою. Вместе такие грифоны подобны великим океанским волнам, которые обрели разум и душу: поражающие и неутомимые. Это настоящие легионы моря."
